## Ignition

Every now and then, I see a Twitter thread on GoLang. Someone is Glazing about GoLang with some statistics, talking about why GoLang is the future. Startups are building their products with GoLang, and there are very good opportunities for GoLang developers. To be honest, my backend skills are not that great. You may ask why? JavaScript. I started with frontend, so the majority of my time was spent learning frontend. I know backend; I can build APIs, but I have never gone deep into backend and DevOps. So, I thought this was the time to do it. Who knows if GoLang will skyrocket in 2025 or not. Either way, knowing one more programming language does not hurt.

## Research

To get started, I just simply Googled "GoLang Books" (something I want to start doing consistently is reading books). I found this Git repository: [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go). I kept searching for some time and found more:

- [www.golang-book.com/books/intro](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)
- [https://gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/)
- [https://gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com/)
- [https://echo.labstack.com](https://echo.labstack.com/) (Go web framework)

And this is what I started with: [https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).

## Initiation

_"Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve productivity in the era of multicore, networked machines, and large codebases. The designers wanted something that had a static type system and runtime like C, was readable and usable like Python, had high performance, and supported networking and multiprocessing. They were motivated by a [shared dislike for C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_C%2B%2B)."_

I started learning GoLang with [go.dev](https://go.dev). This is a better way to start learning a language. After this, I intend to read a book on GoLang once I know the basics.
