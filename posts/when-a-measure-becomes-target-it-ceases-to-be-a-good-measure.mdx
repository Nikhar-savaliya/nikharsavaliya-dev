## New Here? Grind LeetCode.

---

Let me paint a picture for you: most tech interviews out there will throw some Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) your way. In fact, a lot of them are fully based on it. So, what's the logical conclusion? Spending hours grinding LeetCode seems like the smart move. But dedicating your entire college life to do **LeetCode only** from day one is foolish. I've seen this type of student; they dive into CodeChef and CodeForces from day one. Their resumes are thin on programming skills but packed with 5+ links to these competitive programming platforms.

Let me take you back to when I first started my engineering journey. The very first question that pops into any new student's mind is, "What should I do to get a job?" The problem is that very few students ask the more important question: "What can I do to become a good engineer over the next four years?" When you're a freshman, you naturally turn to your seniors for advice. Guess what? Most of them don't have a clue either. You’ll often hear this never-ending debate about **Development vs. DSA**. Why? Because that's the trend. Every academic year, it’s like clockwork; freshers are told to choose between the two like it’s some kind of life-altering decision. I was no different.

For the first couple of years, I followed this mindset. I dove headfirst into learning DSA, participating in CodeForces contests, and only cracked open my course books a few days before exams. In hindsight, those were two wasted years. I could've used that time to explore deeper subjects like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, DBMS, and the very fundamentals that make an engineer, well... an engineer.

## The State of Being Realized

Back then, I didn’t realize the value of books. I thought, "Why bother when there are YouTube tutorials and online playlists, right?" But let me tell you—books are your best friends when you truly start to understand how much they hold. The depth, the knowledge, the insights far exceed any YouTube video or tutorial. Unfortunately, I learned this a little late.

When you realize that the essence of computer science is what truly counts, you unlock a powerful skill—the ability to learn anything. Don't you think having this knowledge would help you find a job? That’s when I began exploring computer science more deeply. I started to understand what happens under the hood of a piece of code, questioning what occurs when you do this or that. This shift from just learning syntax to understanding the intricacies is like taking a U-turn toward expertise. Not everyone would think the same way as I do at this point; most would target mastering DSA.

When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

DSA in job interviews is meant to assess problem-solving skills and critical thinking. If most people treat **DSA** as their sole focus and if they’re just memorizing solutions, what real value does DSA provide today? In such cases, doesn’t this measure cease to be a good measure?
